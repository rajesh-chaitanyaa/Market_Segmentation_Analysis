# Market_Segmentation_Analysis

## What is Market Segmentation?

It is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, 
into sub-groups of consumers based on shared characteristics. Consumer characteristics are very important for market segmentation. 
Approaches to market segmentation analysis: There are two systematics, one uses as its basis the extent to which the organization 
is willing or able to make changes to their current approach of targeting the market or a segment of the market. The second
systematics is based on the nature of the segmentation variable.
